# João Bosco Dos Reis Becker portfolio
This project is a simple personal portfolio showing my professional experiences so far.

## How did I make this site?
Simple website using HTML5 CSS3 and a video as a background.

### Structure
How GitHub lets you upload just one page called index.html
I decided to put the files all in the project's rair

#### Features
